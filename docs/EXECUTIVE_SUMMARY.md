# QSFL-CAAD Executive Summary

## Quantum-Safe Federated Learning with Client Anomaly and Attack Detection

---

## Executive Overview

**QSFL-CAAD** represents a breakthrough in secure distributed machine learning, addressing two critical challenges facing modern AI systems: the impending threat of quantum computing to current cryptographic standards and the growing sophistication of adversarial attacks in federated learning environments.

As organizations increasingly adopt federated learning to train AI models while preserving data privacy, they face unprecedented security challenges. Traditional cryptographic protections will become obsolete with the advent of quantum computers, while malicious participants can poison models through sophisticated attack vectors. QSFL-CAAD provides a comprehensive solution that ensures both quantum-resistant security and intelligent threat detection.
