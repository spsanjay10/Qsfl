# Requirements Document

## Introduction

QSFL-CAAD (Quantum-Safe Federated Learning with Client Anomaly and Attack Detection) is a secure federated learning system designed to protect against both quantum computing threats and malicious client attacks. The system combines post-quantum cryptography, client authentication, and AI-driven anomaly detection to ensure secure and robust distributed machine learning.

The system addresses the growing need for federated learning systems that can withstand future quantum attacks while maintaining security against current threats like model poisoning and adversarial clients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Post-Quantum Security Layer

**User Story:** As a federated learning system administrator, I want quantum-resistant cryptographic protection for all client-server communications, so that the system remains secure even against future quantum computing attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client initiates communication with the server THEN the system SHALL establish a secure channel using CRYSTALS-Kyber key exchange
2. WHEN a client sends model updates to the server THEN the system SHALL authenticate the update using CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signatures
3. WHEN post-quantum libraries are not available THEN the system SHALL use simulated implementations based on NIST specifications
4. WHEN key exchange occurs THEN the system SHALL generate and exchange quantum-safe encryption keys with at least 128-bit security level
5. WHEN digital signatures are verified THEN the system SHALL reject any updates with invalid or missing Dilithium signatures

### Requirement 2: Client Authentication Module

**User Story:** As a federated learning server operator, I want to authenticate each client using quantum-safe credentials, so that only authorized participants can contribute to the federated learning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new client joins the federation THEN the system SHALL issue quantum-safe credentials using Dilithium key pairs
2. WHEN a client attempts to submit model updates THEN the server SHALL verify the client's identity using Dilithium signature verification
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL reject the client's update and log the authentication failure
4. WHEN credentials expire THEN the system SHALL provide a secure re-authentication mechanism
5. WHEN a client is revoked THEN the system SHALL maintain a revocation list and reject future communications from that client

### Requirement 3: AI-Driven Anomaly Detection Engine

**User Story:** As a federated learning system, I want to automatically detect and handle malicious client updates, so that the global model remains accurate and secure against poisoning attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client submits model updates THEN the system SHALL score the update using Isolation Forest anomaly detection
2. WHEN an update is flagged as suspicious THEN the system SHALL generate SHAP explanations for the anomaly score
3. WHEN malicious behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL dynamically reduce the client's influence in model aggregation
4. WHEN a client consistently submits anomalous updates THEN the system SHALL quarantine the client from future aggregation rounds
5. WHEN anomaly scores exceed a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automated response protocols
6. WHEN explanations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide interpretable reasons for flagging specific updates

### Requirement 4: Federated Learning Simulation Environment

**User Story:** As a researcher or developer, I want to simulate federated learning with both honest and malicious clients, so that I can validate the system's security and performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL create 5-10 simulated clients using MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets
2. WHEN clients are initialized THEN the system SHALL designate at least one client as malicious with poisoned gradient injection capabilities
3. WHEN federated learning rounds execute THEN the system SHALL aggregate updates from all authenticated clients
4. WHEN malicious updates are detected THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved global model accuracy compared to unprotected aggregation
5. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on detection accuracy, false positive rates, and model performance
6. WHEN using TensorFlow/PySyft THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with standard federated learning frameworks

### Requirement 5: System Integration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging of all security events, so that I can maintain situational awareness and respond to threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any cryptographic operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the operation type, client ID, and success/failure status
2. WHEN anomaly detection triggers THEN the system SHALL log the anomaly score, SHAP explanations, and response actions
3. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of all authentication attempts
4. WHEN the system detects patterns of malicious behavior THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for administrative review
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track model accuracy, convergence rates, and security event frequencies

### Requirement 6: Modular Architecture and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured, testable codebase with clear module boundaries, so that I can easily maintain, extend, and validate the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN each core component SHALL be developed as an independent, testable module
2. WHEN unit tests are written THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage across all modules
3. WHEN integration tests are created THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end workflows including attack scenarios
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN each module SHALL include clear API documentation and usage examples
5. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL follow Python best practices with proper package organization
6. WHEN demonstrations are prepared THEN the system SHALL include reproducible examples showing security features in action
